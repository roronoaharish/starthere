# Leaf Classifier 



There are hundreds of kinds of trees in the natural ecosystem, and it can be very difficult to distinguish between them. Botanists and those who study plants however, are able to identify the type of tree at a glance by using the characteristics of the leaf. Machine learning is used to automatically classify leaf types. This is study and proposal based on Deep learning. The aim of the project to create a classifier to correctly classify and recognize the leaf using Mathematica as an essential tool. The proposed idea will be based on Convolution Neural Network (CNN) which is used while applying Deep Learning to Image Processing.
